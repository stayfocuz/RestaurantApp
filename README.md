Python Restaurant Ordering System üì±üçΩÔ∏è
A console-based Filipino restaurant ordering system written in Python - coded entirely on an Android phone using Pydroid during my beginner programming days!
üéØ About This Project
This is one of my early Python projects, created when I was just starting to learn programming. Like my C++ quiz project, this was entirely written on my Android phone using the Pydroid app during my leisure time. It showcases a complete restaurant ordering experience with authentic Filipino dishes.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Menu Display
11 traditional Filipino dishes with prices
Alphabetically organized menu (A-K)
Clean, formatted presentation


Smart Order Processing
Multiple dish ordering capability
Quantity selection for each dish
Letter-based menu selection (A, B, C, etc.)
Rice add-on option


Robust Input Validation
Exception handling for invalid inputs
Type checking (numbers vs letters)
Range validation for menu choices
Positive number enforcement


Complete Billing System
Itemized order summary
Individual item calculations
Rice cost calculation
Final total computation
Professional receipt format

üöÄ How to Run

Option 1: Online IDEs (Easiest for Beginners) üåê
Quick Start - No Installation Required:
-Replit Python: https://replit.com/languages/python3
Copy and paste the code
Click "Run" to start ordering
Perfect for beginners!
-Programiz Python Compiler: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/
Copy and paste the code
Click "Run" to execute
Great for testing and learning
-OnlineGDB Python: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler
Copy and paste the code
Select Python 3
Click "Run" to start the restaurant experience

Option 2: Local Installation
Prerequisites: Python 3.x installed on your system
Save the code as restaurant.py
Run the program:
bashpython restaurant.py
# or
python3 restaurant.py

üì± Mobile Users
Since this was originally coded on mobile with Pydroid, you can also run it using:
Android: Pydroid 3, QPython, or Termux
iOS: Pythonista or Carnets

üéÆ How to Use
View the menu with Filipino dishes and prices
Enter how many different dishes you want to order
Select dishes by typing their corresponding letters (A, B, C, etc.)
Specify quantity for each dish
Choose how many cups of rice to add (or type 0 for none)
Review your order summary and total bill
Enjoy your virtual Filipino meal! üáµüá≠

üîß Technical Implementation
Language: Python 3
Development Environment: Pydroid (Android app)

Key Python Concepts Used:
Lists and tuples for data storage
For loops and while loops
String manipulation and formatting
Exception handling (try/except blocks)
Input validation and type checking
List comprehensions
ASCII character operations

üêõ Known Beginner Code Characteristics
As this was written during my early Python learning days, you'll notice some areas that could be optimized:
Some variable names could be more descriptive
Code structure could be more modular with functions
Some repetitive validation logic could be consolidated
Magic numbers could be made into constants

These characteristics are preserved to show the authentic learning journey!

üì± The Mobile Coding Story
This entire project was written on an Android phone using the Pydroid app. Mobile Python development came with its own set of challenges:
Limited screen space for code review
Touch keyboard for coding (no physical keys)
Debugging without proper IDE tools
Managing indentation (crucial in Python!) on mobile

The project demonstrates that learning programming is possible anywhere, anytime - even on a small screen during leisure time!
üáµüá≠ Cultural Touch

The menu features authentic Filipino dishes:
Mechado: Beef stew with tomatoes and potatoes
Adobo: Philippines' national dish with soy sauce and vinegar
Sinigang: Sour soup with tamarind broth
Paksiw: Fish cooked in vinegar and spices
Inihaw: Grilled meat or fish
Ginataan: Dishes cooked in coconut milk
Kalderita: Filipino stew with liver sauce

üéì What I Learned
Python syntax and data structures
Exception handling and error management
User input validation techniques
String formatting and output presentation
List manipulation and iteration
Conditional logic and flow control
Mobile development constraints and solutions

ü§ù Contributing
While this is a personal learning project, feel free to:
Fork and create your own restaurant system
Add more dishes or cuisines
Implement additional features (discounts, taxes, etc.)
Improve the code structure as a learning exercise
